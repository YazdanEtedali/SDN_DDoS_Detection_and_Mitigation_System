# Network Anomaly Detection System

## Description
This project implements a network anomaly detection system using Ryu, an SDN framework, and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes incoming network traffic in real-time, predicts anomalies based on packet features, and logs data to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Features
- Real-time packet analysis
- Anomaly detection using machine learning models
- CSV logging of network traffic features
